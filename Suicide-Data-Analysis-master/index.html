                <h2>What is Suicide ?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Mental disorders (including depression, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders), physical disorders (such as chronic fatigue syndrome), and substance abuse (including alcoholism and the use of and withdrawal from benzodiazepines) are risk factors.Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress (such as from financial or academic difficulties), relationship problems (such as breakups or divorces), or harassment and bullying.Approximately 1.5% of all deaths worldwide are by suicide.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">The most commonly adopted method of suicide varies from country to country and is partly related to the availability of effective means.[16] Common methods of suicide include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms.] This makes suicide the 10th leading cause of death worldwide.Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind.</p>

                <h2>Why do people suicide?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">While tens of thousands of people die by suicide every year, it's estimated that millions of people consider suicide, plan a suicide attempt, or attempt suicide and survive.It is important to know that dying by suicide is not caused by weakness, a personality flaw, or selfishness. These are stigmatized explanations of why suicide happens and can discourage people experiencing suicidal thoughts from asking for help.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Having a mental illness can increase the risk of dying by suicide, but the relationship between the two isn't always that simple.Some mental health conditions, like depression and substance use disorder, are most commonly associated with suicide. However, other conditions like anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders may also increase suicide risk.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Experiencing trauma can significantly affect you at any age. However, childhood trauma is one of the more significant long-term risk factors for suicide.2 Some examples of childhood trauma include emotional neglect, physical abuse, losing a parent, sexual assault, and bullying. Unfortunately, these risk factors are accumulative, meaning the more traumatic life events you experience, the higher your risk of attempting suicide.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Challenging real-life stressors can lead to suicidal thoughts and increase someone's chances of dying by suicide.2,4 This can especially be true if someone lacks the skills or social support to cope with stress.</p>
                
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">People who are suicidal feel hopeless and pessimistic about their future. While it's typical to experience an occasional feeling of hopelessness, people at risk for suicide are more likely to experience rumination—meaning they may get stuck on repetitive, negative feelings or have recurring thoughts about death.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Gender, race, sexual orientation, and age all impact suicide risk. While women attempt suicide more often than men, men die by suicide at higher rates.Certain marginalized communities, like people in the LGBTQIA community, have a higher risk for suicide.Trans people often experience discrimination, bullying, and stigma—all of which can increase suicide risk.People with disabilities are at-risk for suicide as well.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Veterans, people who live in rural areas, and Indigenous communities are also disproportionately impacted by suicide.7 Suicide does not discriminate when it comes to identity, but the trauma exposure, stress, discrimination, and societal challenges that certain groups face may put them more at risk.</p><br>
